My mpv Lua scripts:

# change-refresh #

Uses nircmd to change the resolution and refresh rate of the monitor to match the playing video.

Saves the original monitor resolution and reverts changes on exit and when hotkey is pressed

# autoload #
Exactly the same as the script available here: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/TOOLS/lua/autoload.lua

However, instead of loading automatically it only loads when a keybind is pressed (Ctrl+f8 by default)
